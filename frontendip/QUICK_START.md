- **React 18** - Modern UI library
- **React Router v6** - Client-side routing
- **CSS3** - Custom styling
- **Dummy Data** - Local data for demonstration

## 📝 Development Tips

### Running the App
```bash
# Development mode with hot reload
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test
```

### Project Structure
```
src/
├── components/       # Reusable UI components
├── pages/           # Page-level components
├── utils/           # Helper functions and data
├── App.js           # Main app component with routes
├── App.css          # Global styles
└── index.js         # Entry point
```

### Adding New Features

1. **Add a new page:**
   - Create component in `src/pages/YourPage/`
   - Import in `App.js`
   - Add route: `<Route path="/your-page" element={<YourPage />} />`

2. **Add a new component:**
   - Create in `src/components/YourComponent/`
   - Export and import where needed

3. **Modify dummy data:**
   - Edit `src/utils/dummyData.js`

## 🎨 Customization

### Colors
The app uses CSS variables defined in `App.css`:
- Primary colors: Green (`#10b981`) and Blue (`#3b82f6`)
- Edit these in the `:root` section

### Styling
- Each component has its own CSS file
- Global styles in `App.css` and `index.css`

## ⚡ Performance

- App uses React Router for fast client-side navigation
- Images are lazy-loaded where applicable
- Production build includes minification and optimization

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Port 3000 already in use:**
```bash
# The app will suggest another port, or kill the process:
# Windows:
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Mac/Linux:
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill
```

**Dependencies not installing:**
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```
